<P> I was born on August 1st 2001 in Bangor Maine. I lived in a Bangor apartment for my first 3 years untill we moved to Waterville. Growing up, my mom ran</P> <P>daycare through our house, so I was always around other kids. Growing up in Maine, we were always outside doing something. whether that was riding our</P> <P>bikes around the neighborhood, exploring the woods around our house, or even hunting squirrels in the backyard.</P>
